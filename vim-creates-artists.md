# vim

Like a month ago, I really, truly, got into vim. Tried it a few times before, but always got stuck when I had to do something quick and switched back to vscode. This time I stormed through it. Claude, GPT, cheatsheets, and suddenly I found a real joy in keeping myself inside the "terrifying" vim. I do think it puts you closer to your creation, and makes you feel like an... artist? Yeah, whatever. Here are my notes on stuff that I would forget otherwise. 

Btw. vanilla vim. Not neovim. 

### Find single character, and go to next/previous

1. Find next closes `,` â€” `f,`
2. Jump to next: `;`
3. Jump to previous: `,`

I think it only works in current line. Maybe.

### Jump to same intendation level

Can't find working one withou macros

### Delete without copying

Prepend blackhole register, ie.: `"_d`
